#  **Mistborn Boost**

**Mistborn Boost** is a **single-player strategy card game** prototype inspired by the emotional Allomancy system from Brandon Sanderson’s *Mistborn* series.
The project explores **emotion-driven decision-making** through a combination of **state-based logic, dynamic gameplay flow, and probabilistic decision mechanics**.


## 🧩 **Overview**
The player competes against **three noble NPCs** at a virtual table.
Each round involves **card passing**, but outcomes are dynamically influenced by **emotional states** manipulated through Allomantic actions.

### 🎯 Objective
Collect **four identical Shard cards** (*Preservation*, *Ruin*, *Odium*, or *Endowment*).

### 🔁 Core Mechanics
* **Card Passing:**
  Each round, all players pass one card clockwise.
* **Emotion System:**
  NPCs maintain an *influence meter* that affects card decisions.
* **Allomantic Actions:**

  * **Soothe (Brass):** Decrease influence, increase rational behaviour.
  * **Riot (Zinc):** Increase influence, promote erratic behaviour.

NPC logic integrates emotional weighting to simulate human unpredictability.

## 🕹️ **Gameplay Flow**

1. Player selects a card to pass.
2. NPCs execute their turns sequentially.
3. Player may use **Soothe** or **Riot** (costs one metal charge).
4. Influence states update dynamically.
5. Game ends when any participant collects four identical Shards.
